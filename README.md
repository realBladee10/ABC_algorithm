# Artificial Bee Colony - Application Example

The program demonstrates the operation of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm using a practical example.  

## Description

This code uses an ABC algorithm to find optimal positions (coordinates) in a room with given parameters. 
Precisely:  
- **The best position for the listener (receiver)**  
- **The best position for the sound source**  

The goal is to optimize the placement of these points, which can have applications in acoustics and space design.

Additionally, code plots: 
1) **failure counter for each of the bees** (after 10 failed iterations the value is being set to zero and algorithm resets itself)
2) **approximated frequency response** of a sound source in given position
